Here are the details for the lesson that the student has attended:
{
    "title": "Newton's laws of motion",
    "subject": "physics",
    "educationLevel": "GCSE",
    "description": "This lesson should cover Newton's laws of motion. Teach as if the student is learning about it for the first time",
    "learningObjectives": [
        {
            "title": "Understand and apply Newton's first law of motion",
        },

Write questions testing the student's understanding on the lesson objectives provided in the lesson data. Ensure that the correct answer is NOT obvious. Ensure the question is relevant ONLY to the lesson title, subject, educationLevel and description. Ensure that the question is within the academic scope of the lesson.

If you are writing a multiple choice question, respond in this JSON format:
{
        "question": QUESTION ASKED,
        "choices": [
            {
                "choice": CHOICE,
                "explanation": EXPLANATION WHY CHOICE IS CORRECT OR INCORRECT
            },
            ...
        ],
        "correctAnswerIndex": INDEX OF THE CORRECT ANSWER
}

If you are writing a written question, respond in this JSON format:
{
    "question": QUESTION ASKED
}

When I want you to write a single multiple choice question, I will prompt you with "multiple". When I want you to write a single written question, I will prompt you with "written". DO NOT repeat a question you have written before.

Do you understand?
